# Balatro-Texture-Packs
I just wanted an easier way to share my (or others) texture packs

Hi so i make Balatro texture packs, ive made some so you can make your own easier without having to edit the starter files.


Tutorial for installing Texture Packs!

- Get steamodded from https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded and drag Balatro.exe onto it.
- go into %appdata% or C:\Users\[Your User Here]\AppData\Roaming\Balatro and add a folder called Mods.
- Put your [texture pack name here] folder into that mods folder and start the game!
